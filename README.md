# SAPL

### Introduction:- 
**SAPL** stands for **Simply Advanced Programming Language**. It's a simple yet advanced middle-level programming language which is being written in Python (for now, it will later be rewritten in SAPL itself, no gurantee). It's licensed under the 2LD OSL(2LazyDevs Open Source License).
### Status:-
The programming language is still in it's early phases so there may be bugs & there is no gurantee that your program may work or not. 
### Version:- 
***1.0***
### How to use:-
- Download the zip file from the releases section, the main branch may be broken
- Make a text file, name it test.sapl
- Paste this:-
 ` # A simple program in SAPL that outputs Hello, World!
   include "io"
   func main() {
   prt("Hello, World!")
   }
  `
- Then enter the command `py main.py test.sapl -o test.exe`
- After compilation, run **test.exe**
- & there you have it, the program then outputs `Hello, World!` or whatever you wrote.
### ToDo List:-
- Arithmetic support
- Variable support
- Better assembely code
- Other stuff
